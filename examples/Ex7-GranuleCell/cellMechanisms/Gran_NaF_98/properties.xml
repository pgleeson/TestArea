Properties associated with the Cell Mechanism which allow it to be loaded into neuroConstruct.

Note the following: 
   The Cell Mechanism name should not contain spaces and should match the name of the directory it's in
   The name and description here will be replaced by the corresponding values in a ChannelML file if found
   The filenames for the mappings are relative to the cellMechanism/(cellMechInstanceName) directory
   Mechanism Type should only have values: Channel mechanism, Synaptic mechanism, Ion concentration

<entry key="Description">Inactivating fast Na+ channel. Note that the abrupt change in the value of tau means that a quite small
        dt (~0.001 ms) is needed to give the same results for a cell with just this channel (and a leak current) on 
        NEURON and GENESIS</entry>
