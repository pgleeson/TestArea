The Examples and Schema directories are taken from the standard NeuroML distribution.

To get the latest version of these move the Examples and Schema dirs away, and use the following commands to get
the latest version from the NeuroML SVN repository:

svn co https://neuroml.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/neuroml/trunk/web/NeuroMLFiles/Examples/ Examples
svn co https://neuroml.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/neuroml/trunk/web/NeuroMLFiles/Schemata/ Schemata

The ChannelMLPrototypes directory outlines how some of the examples can be incorporated 
as templates for channels in neuroConstruct

The other files in this dir are remnants of older methods of creating channels in 
neuroConstruct and can be ignored...
