This is a file to retrieve a set of neuroConstruct projects from the Open Source Brain repository.

See http://www.opensourcebrain.org for more details.

The sources of these projects are *mainly* in GitHub repositories, e.g. https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/CA1PyramidalCell

Run:
      
	./checkOsb.sh

to check whether the local copies of the repositories are up to date (or to clone the repositories for the first time), or

	./checkOsb.sh -u

will pull the latest sources from the remote repositories

NOTE: 

Structure of this checkout will possibly change, e.g. should it be invertebrate/lobster or invertebrate/crustacea/lobster...
