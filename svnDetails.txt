
Instructions on obtaining & compiling the latest neuroConstruct code from the 
Subversion repository


Get the latest version of Subversion from http://subversion.tigris.org *

The main neuroConstruct code can be checked out with the command:

svn co svn://87.106.103.176:3999/neuroConstruct/trunk neuroConstruct

After the first successful checkout, run 

    ./updatenC.sh (Linux/Mac) 
or 
    updatenC.bat (Windows) 

in the neuroConstruct directory, as there are some NeuroML files needed
that reside at the NeuroML Sourceforge repository. Running the updatenC command
in future (as opposed to just "svn update") will ensure a consistent set of
neuroConstruct source, NeuroML files and example models.

The Java code needs to be compiled and run with the command "ant run", so install
Ant too: http://ant.apache.org *. Note: you should be able to compile and run 
neuroConstruct using "nC.bat -make" and "nC.bat" respectively (replace with nC.sh
on Linux/Mac) without Ant.

The Java code is best viewed using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). 
NetBeans is used for development of neuroConstruct, and there is a NetBeans project
present in directory nbproj, which can be used to view the code, build and run 
the application.


* Java, Subversion and Ant can be normally be installed with the standard packet
manager of most Linux distributions (e.g. YAST on SUSE). Java is preinstalled on
Macs, Subversion and Ant should be available when the Xcode package is installed.
For Windows, you need just download TortoiseSVN (http://tortoisesvn.net) as this
can be used to checkout/update/commit from Explorer and includes command line
tools such as svn.
