------------------------------------

Get the latest version of Subversion from http://subversion.tigris.org/.
The main neuroConstruct code can be checked out with the command:

svn co svn://87.106.103.176:3999/neuroConstruct/trunk neuroConstruct

After the first successful checkout, run ./updatenC.sh (Linux/Mac) or updatenC.bat 
(Windows), as there are some NeuroML files needed that reside at the NeuroML Sourceforge 
repository. Running the updatenC command in future (as opposed to just "svn update") 
will ensure a consistent set of neuroConstruct source, NeuroML files and example models.

The Java code needs to be compiled and run with the command "ant run",
so install Ant too: http://ant.apache.org/.

Java, svn and ant can be normally be installed with the standard packet 
manager of most Linux distributions (e.g. YAST on SUSE).
