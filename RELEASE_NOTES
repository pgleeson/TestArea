Release notes/change log for neuroConstruct

See also the README file


--- Version 1.0.3 (XXXXXX)

- Update to options for stimulations (Tab Input and Output): repeated pulses, ...
- Some extra tool tips added
- Fixed minor bug where project file modified date is changed on loading of project
- Caught most (but not all) sources of problems for NEURON/cygwin GENESIS when spaces are present in a
  Windows file/directory name, e.g. C:\Documents and Settings\Padraig Gleeson\nC_projects
- Uses NeuroML v1.6
- Added dialog box choice when prev simulation has been reloaded and generate NEURON/GENESIS is requested.
  Had been a problem that no plots were generated in that case as no info on plots is stored with simulation info.
- Made generated GENESIS more portable between directories: one variable targetDir specifies where all sim data will be stroed
- Removed use of the NEURON system() calls in generated scripts when running under windows, to deal with some instability there. Mainly recording of hostname, date, etc.
