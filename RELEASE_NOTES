Release notes/change log for neuroConstruct

See also the README file


--------- Version 1.0.9beta (May 08) ---------


- Added option of saving morphologies in smaller, more efficient format. Existing projects still use old method, 
  new ones use the smaller format by default. See "Morphology save format" in Glossary.

- Changed handling of mod file generation. Biggest practical change is now mod files are only compiled once (the first time 
  NEURON scripts are generated), unless any of the XML/XSL files are altered. An option "Copy sim files to results dir" is added,
  to either use mod files/compiled libraries in the location they're generated (generateNEURON dir, this is default now), or copy 
  the files to simulations/Sim_xx and use them there. This second option was the previous way of using accessing the mods, and 
  may have been the cause of some problems in the past. Another option "Generate all mod files" has been added, to compile all 
  mod files in project, even if the cell mechanism isn't used in this simulation configuration.

- NeuroML version 1.7.1 is used. Some of the proposed changes to NetworkML for v2.0 are now included as options, and the old format
  will be disabled in v2.0, see http://www.morphml.org:8080/NeuroMLValidator/ReqVersion2.jsp. The new format is used in the export of 
  NetworkML, but both formats can eb loaded back in. Other changes in NeuroML v1.7.1 are **unstable & subject to change** new synaptic
  mechanism features (e.g. STP).

- NeuroML export tab is slightly updated.

- Cleaned up electrotonic length handling & updated docs/glossary.

- HDF5 support is added for importing plots/generic traces as 1D datasets in HDF5 files. Also saving and loading of NetworkML
  structure in HDF5 (note: provisional structure & subject to change!)

- Corrected bug in equation parser (used for plotting generic expressions for rate variables in ChannelML files). Expressions like
  exp ((-v - 40)/ 10) were being parsed as: exp ((-1 * (v - 40))/ 10)

- Solved bug when Input is placed on, e.g. seg id 0, but no seg id 0 is present in cell. Also resolved problem
  when new Input is added but there's no synaptic mechanism present to use for Random stim.

- Made generation of Matlab and IgorPro extra files for each simulation optional (via Settings. Default: don't generate)

- Added more options under Help menu item, including link to check for updates.

- For single compartment, spherical cells, the fract along is now always 0.5 in generated network connections

- Can now import GENESIS morphologies which use double_endpoint.

- Gap junctions & point processes (for integrate & fire mechanism) added as possible mechanism types (incomplete)

- Minor additions to project validation: checks if Cell Groups referred to in Elec Inputs and Plots are present in project



--------- Version 1.0.4.1 (Aug 07) ---------


- Only significant update is a bug fix for running NEURON from nC on a Mac (v1.0.4 ran fine on 
  Mac, but couldn't run the generated NEURON scripts). More warnings about installing Developer tools
  (XCode) after installing NEURON on the Mac are included too.



--------- Version 1.0.4 (Aug 07) ---------


- Uses NeuroML v1.6. Changes to that are listed at http://www.morphml.org:8080/NeuroMLValidator/NeuroMLFiles/Schemata/v1.6/RELEASE_NOTES. 
  Main change is addition of <status> element in ChannelML, which is picked up in nC when validating proj with non stable 
  ChannelML elements
  
- Allows user to change default location of new projects, from <user home dir>/nC_projects to wherever (note: no space allowed in dir name)

- Added phase plane plots (dV/dt versus V), for analysis of regular spiking cells, via Plot Info -> Spike Analysis

- Update to options for stimulations (tab Input and Output): pulses can be repeated. Required new version of IClamp.mod (CurrentClampExt)

- Updated import of SWC files. Fixed error of giving segments numbers as names (added suffix Comp_), added a number of options on import and
  now group compartments in unbranched dendrites into Sections with multiple Segments. Note: this will lead to fewer sections when run on NEURON
  but the nseg value will have to be increased in long dendrites (see next point).

- Added changable values for max and min electrotonic length at tab Export Network-> Common Simulation Settings. Added possibility to remesh morphology
  to ensure correct number of internal simulation points/divisions in sections (nseg). Visualise the cell in 3D, showing All Solids, click on any 
  section, then Edit... and select Remesh option in drop down function selector.

- Added more information in network generation summary on total synaptic conductance for post synaptic cells

- Updated import of NeuroML morphologies, to ease NEURON ModelView exported files. 
  See http://neuroml.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/neuroml/nrn2NeuroML/ to export cells from NEURON in Level 1 & 2 NeuroML.

- Some extra tool tips added, along with warnings/advice, e.g. info on getting extra memory in run.bat/run.sh. Updated Glossary and added a number of
  new entries.

- Fixed minor bug where project file modified date is changed on loading of project; now reflects when proj last saved

- Caught most (but not all) sources of problems for NEURON/cygwin GENESIS when spaces are present in a
  Windows file/directory name, e.g. C:\Documents and Settings\Padraig Gleeson\nC_projects. Will give specific warnings 
  when spaces are present in a directory name: this can cause errors when file names are handed to the process running NEURON, 
  for example. If an error is thrown, the project should be copied (Save as..) in a dir without spaces in the name.
  
- Added dialog box choice when a previous simulation has been reloaded and generate NEURON/GENESIS is requested.
  Had been a problem that no plots were generated in that case, as no info on plots is stored with simulation structure.
  
- Made generated GENESIS more portable between directories: one variable targetDir specifies where all sim data will be stroed

- Removed use of the NEURON system() calls in generated scripts when running under Windows, to deal with some instability there. 
  Was mainly used for recording of hostname, date, etc.



--------- Version 1.0.1 (Apr 07) ---------


Basically the same as v0.9.8, but with examples outlined in paper included.



--------- Version 0.9.8 (Mar 07) ---------


The first full public release, just before publication of the paper. Uses NeuroML v1.5
