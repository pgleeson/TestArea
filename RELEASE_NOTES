Release notes/change log for neuroConstruct

See also the README file


--- Version 1.0.4 (XXXXXX)

- Uses NeuroML v1.6. Changes to that are at http://www.morphml.org:8080/NeuroMLValidator/NeuroMLFiles/Schemata/v1.6/RELEASE_NOTES. Main change is 
  addition of <status> element in ChannelML, which is picked up in nC when validating proj with non stable ChannelML elements
  
- Allows user to change default location of new projects, from <user home dir>/nC_projects

- Added phase plane plots (dV/dt versus V), for analysis of regular spiking cells, via Plot Info -> Spike Analysis

- Update to options for stimulations (Tab Input and Output): repeated pulses, ...

- Some extra tool tips added

- Fixed minor bug where project file modified date is changed on loading of project; now reflects when proj last saved

- Caught most (but not all) sources of problems for NEURON/cygwin GENESIS when spaces are present in a
  Windows file/directory name, e.g. C:\Documents and Settings\Padraig Gleeson\nC_projects. Will give specific warnings 
  when spaces are present in a directory name: this can cause errors when file names are handed to the procss running NEURON, for example
  
- Added dialog box choice when prev simulation has been reloaded and generate NEURON/GENESIS is requested.
  Had been a problem that no plots were generated in that case as no info on plots is stored with simulation info.
  
- Made generated GENESIS more portable between directories: one variable targetDir specifies where all sim data will be stroed

- Removed use of the NEURON system() calls in generated scripts when running under Windows, to deal with some instability there. 
  Mainly recording of hostname, date, etc.
