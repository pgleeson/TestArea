<p>Most neuroConstruct <a href="Glossary_gen.html#Project">Projects</a> will illustrate not just a single aspect of a cell
    or network, but will seek to show how the cells react under different inputs, or how a network behaves
    with different <a href="Glossary_gen.html#Cell Group">Cell Groups</a>s/cell populations present, etc. A particular Simulation <br/>
                 Configuration has a number of Cell Groups, Network Connections, Electrical Inputs, and Plots <br/>
                 associated with it, along with a simulation duration. </p>

<p>One of these configurations must be specified
                 when the network is generated, indicating which of the aspects of the model is to be simulated. A Default
                 Simulation Configuration is always present, and if there is only this one, all new Cell Groups, etc. will be<br/>
                 automatically associated with it; otherwise new Cell Groups, Network Connections, etc. have to be manually added to <br/>
                 whichever particular Simulation Configuration they are required for.  </p>
