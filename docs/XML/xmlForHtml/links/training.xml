<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This course, being run by the <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/silverlab/">Silver Lab @ UCL</a>, will provide an introduction
to 3D biophysically detailed neuronal modelling and
recent advances in 2-photon imaging methods for studying rapid neuronal signalling. Creation of multicompartmental,
conductance based neuronal models has been greatly facilitated by software packages such as <a  href="http://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/">NEURON</a>
and <a  href="http://www.genesis-sim.org/GENESIS">GENESIS</a>
and a range of detailed cell and network models are available which are faithful to the anatomical and biophysical
properties of the corresponding biological entities. <a  href="http://www.neuroconstruct.org" >neuroConstruct</a> is an application
which facilitates the construction and analysis of such models through a 3D graphical interface and automates
code generation for a number of widely used simulators. </p>

<p>The course will give an overview of the field of detailed
compartmental modelling and how it can complement experimental approaches including 2-photon imaging. It will
consist of some introductory lectures on modeling and imaging, provide hands on experience of using neuroConstruct,
introduce the existing cortical, cerebellar and hippocampal models which are already available in this format, and outline
the process of creating new models from experimental data. The course will also cover the simulator independent model
description language <a href="http://www.neuroml.org/">NeuroML</a> and the <a href="http://www.neuroml.org/tool_support.php">growing number of tools available</a> for handling models in this format.</p>

<p>This course is primarily intended for participants in the <a href="http://www.brain-train.nl/">BrainTrain</a> and
<a href="http://www.cerebnet.eu/">Marie Curie Cerebnet</a> training programs,
although there are a limited number of places available for other researchers.</p>
