        <name>Cell</name>
        <defined>neuroConstruct holds all information on prototype neurons to be used in networks in a single object of this name.
        It contains information on the cell name, description, cellular morphology, locations of <a href="#Channel Mechanism">
        Channel Mechanisms</a>, <a href="#Synaptic Connection Location">synaptic locations</a>, etc. Grouping this information in one place
        allows checking of the internal consistency of the infomation, e.g. whether the morphology would produce a sensible neuron
        in 3D</defined>

    <term>
        <name>Cell Type</name>
        <defined>A prototype cell containing information on its 3D morphology and the various <intref>Cell density mechanism</intref>s which determine its electrophysiological behaviour.<br/>
        Each <intref>Cell Group</intref> specifies a particular Cell Type and from these networks are built. Cell Types can be hard-coded (e.g. Simple Cell, Purkinje Cell)<br/>
        (which can form the basis of manually edited abstract neurons) or ones based on imported morphology files, e.g. using GenesisMorphReader<br/>
        where a morphology file (ending in .p) as used in <intref>GENESIS</intref> is specified. A Cell Type can be checked for <a  href="Glossary_gen.html#Validity checks">validity</a>. More on<br/>
        Cell Types in the <a  href="celltypes.html">main documentation</a></defined>

    <term>
        <name>Cell Group</name>
        <defined>A number of cells of the same <intref>Cell Type</intref> positioned in 3D space.
                 These will be laid out relative to a specified <intref>Region</intref> <br/>
                 and arranged according to a <intref>Packing Pattern</intref>. Only Cell Groups<br/>
                 included in the selected <intref>Simulation Configuration</intref> will be generated.</defined>

        <name>Simulation Configuration</name>
        <defined>Most neuroConstruct <intref>Project</intref>s will illustrate not just a single aspect of a cell <br/>
                 or network, but will seek to show how the cells react under different inputs, or how a network behaves <br/>
                 with different <intref>Cell Group</intref>s/cell populations present, etc. A particular Simulation <br/>
                 Configuration has a number of Cell Groups, Network Connections, Electrical Inputs, and Plots <br/>
                 associated with it, along with a simulation duration. As an example, a project accompanying a publication<br/>
                 might have one Simulation Configuration for each figure in the paper. More on Simulation Configurations in <br/>

        <name>NEURON</name>
        <defined>NEURON is a simulation environment for developing and exercising models of neurons and networks of neurons. <br/>
                The main tasks of actually simulating what goes on inside the neurons of a network built with neuroConstruct <br/>
                is done by simulation packages such as NEURON. The package is available for download <a target="_blank" href="http://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/">here</a>.<br/>

        <name>Cvapp</name>
        <defined>This Java application, developed by Robert Cannon, allows transformation between various morphology formats
        (e.g. from <intref>Neurolucida</intref> to <intref>NEURON</intref> or <intref>GENESIS</intref>), editing of loaded
        morphologies, along with other functions for cleaning up and optimising morphology files. It also has its own

        <name>Neurolucida</name>
        <defined>A product by MicroBrightField Bioscience which is a system for "3D neuron reconstruction, serial section reconstruction, and anatomical mapping".
        It is a popular product for creating 3D morphological reconstructions of neurons with complex dendritic trees (although this is not the only functionality).
        A number of databases exist containing neuronal information in the file format used by these products. neuroConstruct can <a  href="import.html#Neurolucida">import</a> these files and extract the
        morphological information to use as the basis of detailed single cell models.</defined>

        <name>NEOSIM</name>
        <defined>NEOSIM is a framework to support large scale multi-level modelling of the nervous system. NEOSIM simulation models<br/>
                 are specified in a recent version the <intref>NeuroML</intref> declarative <intref>XML</intref> model specification language. More information on the current status is available <a target="_blank" href="http://www.neosim.org/">here</a>.</defined>

    <term>
        <name>Cell Mechanism</name>
        <defined>A general term for an electrophysiological process (currently  either a <intref>Channel Mechanism</intref>, a <intref>Synaptic Mechanism</intref> or an <intref>Ion Concentration</intref>) which is placed <br/>
        on modelled cell membranes or at the interface of two cells to alter their internal electrical and chemical state.<br/>

    <term>
        <name>Ion Concentration</name>
        <defined>A term used for a mechanism describing how the internal concentration of an ion alters. An example would be a pool of calcium, which decays to a resting value.</defined>

    </term>


    <term>
        <name>Action Potential Propagation Speed</name>
        <defined>While the 3D structure of axons is important for creating the correct connectivity (e.g parallel fibers in cerebellar granule cells)<br/>
        the segments representing these axons need not necessarily be explicitly modelled, indeed physiological data on the channels<br/>
        present etc. can be quite difficult to obtain. Instead an average value for the speed of propagation of the Action Potential can<br/>
        be used for these segments, with the axonal propagation delay (calculated using the distance along the segments to the last fully modelled segment)<br/>
        added to the internal synaptic mechanism delay. To specify sections which should be modelled using Action Potential Propagation Speeds, select<br/>
        <intref>Cell density mechanism</intref> in the drop down box when viewing a single cell in the <b>Visualisation</b> tab. Note that reducing the number of<br/>
        explicitly modelled segments will reduce the simulation runtime.</defined>
    </term>

    <term>
        <name>Cell density mechanism</name>
        <defined>A term used to describe the mechanisms which can be applied to cell segments to allow simulation of electrophysiological<br/>
                 mechanisms. Density refers to the fact the the effect of the mechanism is dependent on the physical size of the segment. A <br/>
                 <intref>Channel Mechanism</intref> is specified as a conductance per unit area, or alternatively an <intref>Action Potential Propagation Speed</intref> measures the <br/>
                 rate of propagation of signals along a segment to synaptic connections. Specific capacitance and specific axial resistance can <br/>
                 be specified on a per group basis also. To specify which cell density mechanisms are present on a cell, select<br/>
        <b>Cell density mechanism</b> in the drop down box when viewing a single cell in the <b>Visualisation</b> tab.</defined>

    <term>
        <name>Compartmentalisation</name>
        <defined>Imported morphologies (e.g. <intref>Neurolucida</intref> files) may not always be in the most efficient spatial discretisation<br/>
                 for a particular simulator (a number of 3D points/daimeters can be specified along an unbranched dendrite to describe the structure,<br/>
                 but these will lead to many segments). A Compartmentalisation is a reorganisation of the structure of segments/sections to retain as many<br/>
                 of the properties the cell which are important for electrophysiological simulations (total membrane area, total axial resistance<br/>
                 along branches, total length etc.) but enables mapping on to a smaller number of simulated compartments. See <intref>GENESIS Compartmentalisation</intref></defined>
    </term>


    <term>
        <name>GENESIS Compartmentalisation</name>
        <defined>This <intref>Compartmentalisation</intref> for the <intref>GENESIS</intref> platform is needed as a simple mapping of each <intref>Segment</intref> in a detailed neuronal reconstruction<br/>
        to a compartment for running on GENESIS would lead to too great a spatial discretization. This Compartmentalisation maps the n Segments in each <intref>Section</intref> on to two CYLINDRICAL Sections<br/>
        each of half the original Section length, with the radii chosen to preserve total curved surface area and total axial resistance along the length. </defined>

    <term>
        <name>Abstract Cell</name>
        <defined>A <intref>Cell Type</intref> which represents a real neuron, but whose morphology is described with a much reduced number of segments.<br/>
        These types of cells are useful for investigating basic electrophysiological properties of cells, or in large networks, where simpler individual cells<br/>
        are needed to reduce simulation time. These cells can be created manually by adding a Cell Type based on the included examples (e.g. SimpleCell), viewing in tab <b>Visualisation</b>,
        clicking on one of the segments, and pressing <b>Edit...</b>.<br/></defined>

    <term>
        <name>Abstracted Cell Mechanisms</name>
        <defined>A <intref>Cell Mechanism</intref> which has been split between model template and parameters, allowing easy mapping onto<br/>
                 each of the available simulation platforms. A limited number of examples exist in the current version of neuroConstruct<br/>
                 e.g. Double Exponential Synapse, Hodgkin Huxley channel. <b>Note: This is a pre-</b><intref>ChannelML</intref><b> approach to implementing
                 Cell Mechanisms and shouldn't be used anymore</b>.</defined>
    </term>

    <term>
        <name>File based Cell Mechanisms</name>
        <defined>A <intref>Cell Mechanism</intref> whose functionality is hard coded in a native simulation environment's scripting language, e.g a mod file <br/>
                 for <intref>NEURON</intref> or a <intref>GENESIS</intref> script file containing a single <intref>Cell Mechanism</intref>.<br/>
                 Note: there can be a script for each simulation environment associated with the Cell Mechanism, but it is up to the modeller to ensure they <br/>
                 produce the same results. Details on how to modify native script files for inclusion in neuroConstruct cells is available in the <a  href="importneuron.html#CellMechanism">main documentation</a></defined>

        <name>NeuroML</name>
        <defined>NeuroML, the Neural Open Markup Language, is an open standard in <intref>XML</intref> for describing models, data, literature, methods and other aspects of neuroscience. <br/>
                 Currently, there are three Levels of compliance to the NeuroML standards:

                <ul>
            <li><b>Level 1</b> provides a common data format for neuronal morphology data and metadata. <intref>MorphML</intref> forms the main part of the specification at this Level.</li>
            <li><b>Level 2</b> builds on Level 1 to include standards for describing passive membrane properties, and the distributions of channels on neuron models.<br/>
                The dynamics of ion channels, synapses, and ion concentration mechanisms can also be described at this Level in <intref>ChannelML</intref></li>
            <li><b>Level 3</b> allows networks of cells to be described, either in template form (from which networks can be generated) or as explicit descriptions of <br/>
                cell placement and synaptic connectivity. The core of this level is described in <intref>NetworkML</intref>.</li>
                </ul>

    </term>

    <term>
        <name>MorphML</name>
        <defined>MorphML is an standard which is being developed (using <intref>XML</intref> technologies) to allow data on cell morphologies to be <br/>
        easily transferred between neuronal simulation applications. More information is available <a target="_blank" href="http://www.morphml.org">here</a>.<br/>
        It is a part of the <intref>NeuroML</intref> initiative, and is the core of NeuroML Level 1.</defined>

    <term>
        <name>ChannelML</name>
        <defined>ChannelML is a standard (using <intref>XML</intref> technologies) for specifying the dynamics of various subcellular processes
        (<intref>Channel Mechanism</intref>s, <intref>Synaptic Mechanism</intref>s, etc.) which are present on biologically accurate model neurons.
        It is a part of Level 2 of the <intref>NeuroML</intref> set of standards.
        The ability to model these mechanisms is one of the key features of platforms like <intref>NEURON</intref> or <intref>GENESIS</intref>, but the implementation
        of the mechanisms is far from trivial, requiring both knowledge of the physiological processes and of a low level programming language. ChannelML seeks to separate the
        electrophysiological data from any specific implementation, defining a template for numerous types of cellular mechanism, containing only the relevant biophysical parameters
        (e.g. reversal potentials, (in)activation variable equations) which can be automatically validated for completeness. These files can then be mapped to
        script files in the language of the target simulator for inclusion in cell models.
        The format for valid ChannelML files is described in an <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/schema/default.asp">XML Schema</a> document.
        Examples of valid ChannelML files and mappings to simulators can be found

        <name>XML</name>
        <defined>Short for Extensible Markup Language, XML is a specification developed by the <a  href="http://www.w3c.org">W3C</a>. XML uses a similar tag structure to HTML, <br/>
        as used for Web documents. However, it allows designers to create their own customised tags, enabling the definition, transmission, validation, <br/>
        and interpretation of data between applications and between organisations. It is useful in the context of neuroscience when it comes to exchanging<br/>
        anatomical data, model descriptions, etc. between research groups and simulation environments and is the technology used in specifying the <intref>NeuroML</intref> standards. </defined>

        <name>Region</name>
        <defined>A volume in 3D space which can be filled with cells. These regions can be also used for specifying bounding regions for selecting cells, e.g. to <br/>
                 selectively apply stimulations, or to aid in analysis of a subset of cells. In the current version of neuroConstruct, regions can be either rectangular <br/>

        <name>Channel Mechanism</name>
        <defined>An implementation of a model of an electrophysiological process (e.g. an ion channel, ion pump, etc.) which is placed <br/>
        on modelled cells' membranes to alter their behaviour. For <intref>NEURON</intref> these are usually implemented in <intref>NMODL</intref>.</defined>
    </term>

    <term>
        <name>Synaptic Mechanism</name>
        <defined>An implementation of a model of synaptic transmission. This is a subtype of a <intref>Cell Mechanism</intref>. Usually this<br/>
                 involves an event in one cell influencing the conductance at a point in another cell. For <intref>NEURON</intref> these are usually implemented<br/>
                 in <intref>NMODL</intref>. Synaptic Mechanisms are needed to specify a <intref>Synaptic Connection Location</intref> on a cell.</defined>

    <term>
        <name>Packing Pattern</name>
        <defined>When cells are placed in a <intref>Region</intref>, the somas need to be arranged in a particular pattern. In neuroConstruct, some of the available patterns are:
            <ul>
            <li><b>Random:</b> Cells are placed in random locations in the Region</li>
            <li><b>Cubic Close Packed:</b> Cells are placed in Cubic Close Packed formation. A layer is placed in 2D first and the spheres in the next layer lie on top, at the center of the 4 spheres underneath, touching each. This is optimal packing of spheres in 3D</li>
            <li><b>Simple Regular:</b> The cells are placed in layers with cell centres directly above each other</li>
            <li><b>Single Placed Cell:</b> A single cell is placed in an exact location in the Region (or relative to the origin)</li>
            <li><b>Hexagonal:</b> The cells are placed in a single layer in a hexagonal pattern (each soma is surrounded by 6 other somas at equal angles)</li>
            <li><b>One Dimensional Regular Spacing:</b> The cells are placed at regular intervals in a straight line </li>
            </ul>
            Note that for each of these packing patterns a number of variables need to be specified, besides the Region, e.g. the number of cells to place, extra cell spacing<br/>
            whether to avoid existing cells from this (or other) <intref>Cell Group</intref>s.<br/>
            New packing patterns can be added by extending the Java class <b>CellPackingAdapter</b>.

<!--  General Cell/morphology terms -->

<term>
    <name>Section</name>
    <defined>Unbranched part of a cell morphology. An example would be a non bifurcating dendritic section, or the soma. <br/>
             Each Section contains at least one <intref>Segment</intref>. The Section provides the start point and <br/>
             start radius, and each of the Segments has an end point and radius corresponding to the 3D points along the Section<br/>
             (these are similar to the pt3d points used to specify sections in <intref>NEURON</intref>). Sections which have similar<br/>
             properties can be assigned to a <intref>Section Group</intref>. All of the Segments in a Section are also in the same <br/>
             Section Groups.</defined>
</term>

<term>
    <name>Segment</name>
    <defined>The basic unit of the morphological description of the cell. Segments correspond to the concept of a compartment as <br/>
             used in <intref>GENESIS</intref>. One or more Segments go to make up a <intref>Section</intref>, which maps to a cable in<br/>
             simulation environments using that concept (e.g. the section in <intref>NEURON</intref>, where the start point of the Section,<br/>
             and the Segment end points provide the pt3d points along the section). A Segment has a unique name, an end point, a pointer to<br/>
             its <intref>Section</intref>, a pointer to its parent Segment, and a value for the fraction (0 to 1) of the parent's <br/>
             length at which it's connected. The first Segment in a Section can be connected at a point between 0 and 1 along<br/>
             its parent segment (in another section) but all other segments need to be connected at the 1 point to their parent.</defined>
</term>

<term>
    <name>Finite volume Segment</name>
    <defined>A <intref>Segment</intref> on a Cell in neuroConstruct, which for the purposes of <a  href="#Packing Pattern">packing</a>
    is considered to take up space. Normally, only Segments in the soma are considered space filling, and will be packed to avoid each other.
    Dendrites and axons are ignored in packing as it would normally be impossible to get these well packed taking into account the dendritic arborisations.
    If large Sections in a specific cell need to be treated differently (e.g. a <intref>Glomerulus</intref>), these Segments can be specified as having
    finite volume</defined>
</term>



<term>
    <name>Section Group</name>
    <defined>A group of <intref>Section</intref>s sharing some properties. These can be used to specify the <intref>Channel Mechanism</intref>s placed<br/>
    on areas of the cell (e.g. apical dendrites), or the locations where specific <intref>Synaptic Mechanism</intref>s are allowed (see <intref>Synaptic Connection Location</intref>).
    There are four special groups:
    <ul>
                 <li><b>all:</b> every Section is included in this Group</li>
                 <li><b>soma_group:</b> The Group containing only one Section, representing the soma</li>
                 <li><b>dendrite_group:</b> The Group of dendritic Sections</li>
                 <li><b>axon_group:</b> The Group of axonal Sections</li>
                 </ul>
                 Every Section is part of one and only one of the last 3 Groups. Sections in groups whose names start with <b>colour_</b>, e.g. <b>colour_Yellow</b>,
                 will be coloured as such in the single cell 3D view (these colourings may come from morphology files, e.g. <intref>Neurolucida</intref> format).
             </defined>
</term>

<term>
    <name>Synaptic Connection Location</name>
    <defined>A <intref>Synaptic Mechanism</intref> can be associated with a list of <intref>Section Group</intref>s. This means that any of the <intref>Section</intref>s in those<br/>
             Groups can be involved in a <intref>Network Connection</intref> involving the Synapse type.<br/>
             Note: Each of the Sections will also be a member of either <b>soma_group</b>, <b>dendrite_group</b> or <b>axon_group</b>. A PRE synaptic connection location is allowed on Sections in<br/>
             <b>soma_group</b> or <b>axon_group</b> while a POST synaptic connection location is allowed on a Section in <b>soma_group</b> or <b>dendrite_group</b>.

             See this <a  href="tutorials/tutorial3.html">tutorial</a> for more on Synaptic Connection Locations and Network Connections</defined>
</term>

<term>
    <name>Simply Connected cell</name>
    <defined>A Cell where each <intref>Segment</intref> is connected to either the start of end point (0 or 1) of its parent</defined>
</term>

<term>
    <name>Morphological validity</name>
     <defined>For a cell with multiple sections and segments, to be considered valid i.e. in a form that will produce sensible,
              similar 3D morphologies in each of the simulators we deal with it should meet the following criteria:
              <ul>
                 <li>  Only one segment without a parent (root segment)</li>
                 <li>  All segments have sections</li>
                 <li>  All segments have endpoints</li>
                 <li>  All Segment IDs unique</li>
                 <li>  All Segment names unique</li>
                 <li>  All Section names unique</li>
                 <li>  Segments after the first in a section are only connected to 1 on parent</li>
                 <li>  At most one segment is spherical and is in the group <b>soma_group</b></li><br/>
                 <li>  At least one segment present in cell</li><br/>
                 <li>  At least one soma section, i.e. section which is in group <b>soma_group</b></li><br/>
                 <li>  Cell name present</li><br/>
                 </ul>
            The following checks, when failed, lead to warnings (due to potential problems when packing, for example):
            <ul>
                 <li>  First soma segment not at origin</li>
                 <li>  Start point matches point at specified fraction along parent</li>
                 <li>  Not a <intref>Simply Connected cell</intref></li>
                 </ul>
        </defined>
</term>

<term>
    <name>Biophysical validity</name>
     <defined>A number of checks can be carried out on the cells in a project to ensure they meet some minimum
         requirements for producing realistic results in the chosen simulators. At the moment these checks are:
         <ul>
             <li>At least one membrane mechanism on each segment</li>
             <li>At least one passive conductance on each segment </li>
         </ul>

         The following checks, when failed, lead to warnings:
         <ul>
             <li>At most one passive conductance on a segment (more than one can lead to erroneous calculations of electrotonic lengths)</li>
         </ul>
         The intention is to expand these checks to make it easier for non/new computational neuroscientists to catch some
         common errors when creating cell models. If there are any suggestions for checks to be made, please <a  href="contact.html" >get in touch</a>.
     </defined>
 </term>

<term>
    <name>Project validity</name>
    <defined>To catch many, but not all, potential sources of error in a project a number of validity checks are performed. These include <br/>
        checks on the morphology and biophysical parameters of each of the cells in the project, and various global checks on the project<br/>
        settings.</defined>
</term>

<term>
    <name>Validity checks</name>
    <defined>Due to the large number of parameters present in a simulation of a network of realistic neurons, a number
        of automated checks have been created to help ensure sensible data is being given to the simulators. Note that these
        are <b>*not complete*</b> and there is still plenty of opportunity for "garbage in, garbage out". There are checks on:
        <ul>
            <li><intref>Morphological validity</intref>: the structure of the cells in the project are valid</li>
            <li><intref>Biophysical validity</intref>: the cells in the project have minimal/sensible biophysical properties set</li>
            <li><intref>Project validity</intref>: the above two checks are performed on each of the cells in the project along with a number of other tests</li>
            </ul>
            Note: projects/cells will work and native scripts can be generated even when not valid, but the simulation results should be treated as suspect.

    <name>Project</name>
    <defined>In neuroConstruct, a Project contains the specification of the <intref>Cell Type</intref>s, <intref>Region</intref>s,<br/>
    <intref>Cell Group</intref>s and <intref>Network Connection</intref>s in a model, along with the simulation parameters (duration, dt, <br/>
    etc.) and inputs into the network. Also associated with a Project are a number of Previous Simulations, <br/>
    i.e. recorded simulations run in a simulation environment (e.g. <intref>NEURON</intref>) which are available for replaying<br/>
    when the project is opened. The main project file (*.neuro.xml) is a proprietary XML file, which should<br/>

<!--  Plots, data etc -->

<term>
    <name>Data Set</name>
    <defined>Set of x, y values which can be plotted in a <intref>Plot Frame</intref>, saved in the <intref>Project</intref> (for reloading through the <intref>Data Set Manager</intref>), exported, etc.
    The x values do not have to be evenly spaced, unique or sequential. See <a  href="#Variables to plot/save">here</a> for information on what variables can be saved/plotted during a simulation run.</defined>
</term>


<term>
    <name>Plot/Graph</name>
    <defined>These terms are used in various ways by <intref>NEURON</intref> and <intref>GENESIS</intref> for a) the frame/window showing a number of sets of data and
    b) the individual sets of points in each trace. In neuroConstruct, <intref>Data Set</intref> is generally used for a set of points which can be plotted, and
    <intref>Plot Frame</intref> is use for the window in which a number of these can be viewed. In the <b>Input and Output</b> tab, the second table lists the values to
    to be plotted during a simulation run. For example, the membrane potential of a subset of cells in each group could be plotted. Note that here too is where variables
    to be saved during the simulation are specified, e.g. all cells' membrane potential could be saved but just one specified to be plotted, etc. The names to use for variables
    to plot and/or save are given <a  href="#Variables to plot/save">here</a>
    </defined>
</term>


<term>
    <name>Variables to plot/save</name>
    <defined>Variables which change during the simulation can be specified to be plotted and/or saved for later display in neuroConstruct via<br/>
             the <b>Input and Output</b> tab. Variables have different names in each of the simulation environments (e.g. v or Vm), so a set of <br/>
             generic names of the most common interesting values has been defined:
    <ul>
        <li><b>VOLTAGE</b> for the membrane potential (v in NEURON, Vm in GENESIS)</li>
        <li><b>SPIKE</b> can be used to record spike trains, as opposed to voltage at every timestep, e.g. <b>SPIKE:-20</b> sets the spike threshold to -20mV</li>
    </ul>
    To plot a value present on a Cell Mechanism, use a colon, e.g. <b>NaConductance:m</b>. Note, as the gate activation<br/>
    variables are a special case, GENESIS will search through the list of gates (only if the Cell Mechanism is defined by a<br/>
    ChannelML file), search for a gate with the specified name, and plot that variable. See Ex4-NEURONGENESIS for an example. <br/>
    Other named variables that can be plotted for Cell Mechanisms are:
    <ul>
        <li><b>CONC</b> for the concentration of an ion, e.g. <b>CaPool:CONC:ca</b></li>
        <li><b>REV_POT</b> for the reversal potential of an ion, e.g. <b>NaConductance:REV_POT:na</b></li>
        <li><b>CURR_DENS</b> for the current density through a channel, e.g. <b>NaConductance:CURR_DENS:na</b></li>
        <li><b>COND_DENS</b> for the conductance density of a channel, e.g. <b>NaConductance:COND_DENS:na</b></li>

    <name>Axes in 3D</name>
    <defined>A set of axes can be added in 3D (either when a single cell is being displayed or a generated network). The green axis represents<br/>
             the x direction, the yellow the y direction and the red the z direction. The axes measure 100 microns from the origin in positive<br/>
             and negative directions, the arrow on the positive. The ticks are at 10 micron intervals. Due to perspective the axes should only be<br/>

    <name>Plot Frame</name>
    <defined>The window in which a number of <intref>Data Set</intref>s can be viewed. Each Plot Frame has a name and new Data Sets can be added to existing Plot Frames.
    The Data Sets can be viewed in a number of different ways: all graphs using the same axes, graphs stacked vertically, zoomed in to user selected area, etc. Each Data Set is
    listed and can be individually analysed (e.g. for mean/std dev values, spiking rates calculated) or the format (colour/point type) edited. See <a  href="#Variables to plot/save">here</a>
    for information on what veriables can be saved/plotted during a simulation run.</defined>
</term>

<term>
    <name>Data Set Manager</name>
    <defined>A number of <intref>Data Set</intref>s can be stored in a neuroConstruct <intref>Project</intref>, showing a concept illustrating a point about the model,
    e.g. an I-F curve derived from a number of simulation runs. When a Data Set is viewed in a <intref>Plot Frame</intref> the points can be saved
    to the project. The Data Set Manager allows these saved Data Sets to be viewed, edited, and redisplayed in a new (or any open) Plot Frame</defined>

    <name>3D View of Cells</name>
    <defined>When a single cell is viewed in 3D (at tab <b>Visualisation</b>, select the name of the <intref>Cell Type</intref> in the drop down box) there are a number of<br/>
             functions possible:
    <ul>
            <li>Left click anywhere in the view and drag to rotate the cell</li>
            <li>Right click anywhere and drag to translate the cell</li>
            <li>Clicking the middle mouse button and dragging (or turning the middle wheel) will zoom the view. Note that if there
            is no middle button, there is a zoom slider bar on the GUI</li>
            <li>Pressing the <b>Find</b> button will reset the view, usually centering on the cell</li>
            <li>Left clicking on one of <intref>Segment</intref>s will highlight that segment and any other segments in the same <intref>Section</intref> (only when <b>All solid</b> is selected)</li>
            <li>When a Segment is selected, a summary of the 3D information on it appears, and the endpoints, etc. can be altered by pressing the <b>Edit...</b> button</li>
    </ul>
    Specifying <intref>Section Group</intref>s allows different subsections of the cell to be assigned as dendrites, etc. and can be used to colour regions of the cells.
    When multiple cells are being displayed (e.g. when <b>Latest Generated Positions</b> is selected, or a simulation is reloaded) the following options are also possible:
        <ul>
            <li>Clicking on part of a cell highlights that cell. Note this is easiest when the level of detail displayed is <b>All Solid</b> (see below). Selecting cells can also be
                difficult is other objects are close, e.g. transparent regions, synaptic endpoint spheres, 3D axes. If a cell can't be selected by clicking, the cell group and cell number can be selected in the drop down boxes.</li>
            <li>When a single cell is selected, checking the Transparent mode box will keep that cell opaque, make cells it's connected to partially transparent and turn other cells almost completely transparent.</li>

        </ul>
    There are a number of settings which can be changed by pressing the <b>3D Settings</b> button:
        <ul>
            <li>The background colour and preferred cell segment colour</li>
            <li>Whether the <a  href="#Axes+in+3D">3D axes</a> will be shown.</li>
            <li>The resolution of 3D elements. <b>Note for better 3D performance when viewing large cells this should be set low (&lt;12)!</b></li>
            <li>A number of items can be excluded or included from the 3D view, e.g. Regions (when viewing generated networks), Inputs, Synaptic Endponts (green for presynaptic location, red for post), etc.</li>
            <li>The level of detail to display (see below)</li>
        </ul>
        The default view for 3D cells is to show all the segments in full solid detail (spheres or cylinders/truncated cones). However this can be too much detail to show on many<br/>
        machines for large cells. The following options allow different views of the cells, either at reduced details, or transformed for a particular simulator:
        <ul>
            <li><b>All solid:</b> all segments are seen in 3D detail. Note the resolution of these can be increased or decreased under <b>3D Settings</b></li>
            <li><b>Soma solid, neurite lines:</b> segments in the soma group are solid, all other segments are lines through their centres</li>
            <li><b>Soma solid, no neurites:</b> just the soma segments are shown in 3D</li>
            <li><b>All lines:</b> all segments are represented by lines</li>
            <li><b>Original Compartmentalisation:</b> a transparent view of the cell, showing the segments in 3D, white lines through their centres, blue spheres for their end points, and yellow lines
            linking segments which are electrically connected, but not physically linked. There will be a red sphere in the middle of each internal division, with small blue spheres connecting them.
            These red spheres correspond to the simulation points in NEURON as defined by nseg</li>
            <li><b>GENESIS Compartmentalisation:</b> this is a <intref>Compartmentalisation</intref> of the cell which converts it to a smaller number of compartments for GENESIS
            but retains the section groups, total surface area, total dendritic length and total axial resistance</li>
        </ul>
        Note: see points on allocating memory for the application <a  href="install.html#Building+and+running">here</a>, which will be important when displaying large networks in 3D.
